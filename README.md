### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at Oracle Consulting as an IaaS Architect.

Previous area of expertise mainly around the VMware (VCP-DCV x3), Citrix (CCIA/CCE-V) & Cisco ecosystems (CCNP DC).

I am focusing on anything OCI since I joined Oracle in 2018, and my favorite tools for the task are Terraform, Packer and Ansible. Morphing into Pythonista mode when things gets serious.

- ðŸ”­ currently working on [Terraform modules for OCI](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=oci)
- ðŸŒ± currently learning GitHub centric automation tools and workflows to enable GitOps approaches for small teams

When I don't craft things, I draw boxes and lines on whiteboards. Eventually with some smiling clouds.
