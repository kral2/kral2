### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ã‡etin, kral2 is my online alter ego.

[I work at HashiCorp][LinkedIn] as a Customer Success Architect.
TL;DR - I am a "learn it all" kind of person, and always eager to share back :smile:

- ðŸ”­ currently working on anything related to the [hashistack] and tends to be an [HCP](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/) fanatic
- ðŸ”­ contributing to [Terraform modules for OCI](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=oci). Maintainer for [VCN], [Compute] and [IAM]
- ðŸŒ± learning GitHub centric automation tools and workflows

Before joining HashiCorp, I was focused on anything related to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, with a big emphasising on automation. My favorite tools for the task were [Terraform], [Packer] and Ansible, while morphing into Pythonista mode when things gets serious.

When I don't craft things, I draw boxes and lines on (virtual) whiteboards. Eventually with some smiling clouds.

My previous areas of expertise are mainly around Data Center/Infrastructure stuff (Systems, Virtualization, Storage, Networking, HCI) and End-User Computing. This is reflected in [my certification graveyard][Acclaim]: VMware (VCP-DCV x3), Citrix (CCIA/CCE-V) & Cisco (CCNP DC) are amongst the tombstones you can see. Other certifications precedes the online badges trend and will receive no love in this world.
