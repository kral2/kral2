### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ã‡etin, kral2 is my online alter ego.

[I work at Oracle][LinkedIn] in the Consulting organization as an IaaS Architect.  
TL;DR - I am a "learn it all" kind of person, and always eager to share back :smile:

My previous areas of expertise are mainly around Data Center/Infrastructure stuff (Systems, Virtualization, Storage, Networking, HCI) and End-User Computing. This is reflected in [my certification graveyard][Acclaim]: VMware (VCP-DCV x3), Citrix (CCIA/CCE-V) & Cisco (CCNP DC) are amongst the tombstones you can see. Others precede the online badges trend and will receive no love in this world.

---
I am focusing on anything OCI since I joined Oracle in 2018 with a big emphasing on automation, and my favorite tools for the task are Terraform, Packer and Ansible. Morphing into Pythonista mode when things gets serious.

- ðŸ”­ currently working on [Terraform modules for OCI](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=oci). Focus on [VCN], [Compute] and [IAM].
- ðŸŒ± currently learning GitHub centric automation tools and workflows to enable GitOps approaches for small teams

When I don't craft things, I draw boxes and lines on whiteboards. Eventually with some smiling clouds.
